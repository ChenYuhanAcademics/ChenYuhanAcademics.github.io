_(This Website Is Under Construction)_

Welcome to my personal website! Here, you can find my contact information and check out my newest research and ideas.

I am an incoming PhD student at MIT's department of biology. Previously, I obtained dual bachelor of science degrees in Pure Mathematics/Molecular and Cell Biology at UC San Diego. There, I conducted undergraduate research on plant epigenetics advised by [Professor Julie Law](https://law.salk.edu) at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies. I was also mentored on (_very_) elementary algebraic geometry and number theory by Professor Cristian Popescu. I am originally from Shanghai, China.


Interests
======
I am interested in regulation of every step in the central dogma. While my primary focus has been on transcriptional gene regulation and chromatin biology, my interests have expanded to include other facets of gene regulation such as post-transcriptional gene regulation, translational regulation, and protein stability.

Originally trained as a geneticist, I have also recieved extensive training in biochemistry and genomics. My goal is to employ techniques from biochemistry and cell biology to achieve a deep mechanistic understanding of gene regulation, while ultimately maintaining a genome-wide perspective. I am particularly eager to utilize the most cutting edge technology, such as proximity labeling, single cell multiomics and live super-resolution microscopy (TIRF, STED, etc.) to tackle the most exciting biological questions.

In addition to experimental work, I was also trained as a pure mathematician, and am enthusiastic to integrate mathematical and physical approaches, such as polymer biophysics, to aid in my research.
