BICD100-UC San Diego-Winter 2024
======
I was an instructional assistant for Dr. Christopher Day's BICD100 (Genetics) course. I lead office hours, graded homework and supervised exams. During this period, I helped connect multiple undergraduate students with their first labs. I recieved _GOOD/VERY GOOD_ ratings for all categories from student evaluations.
