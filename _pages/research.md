Salk Institute of Biological Studies- _Law Lab_
======
I was an undergraduate researcher in Professor Julie Law’s lab at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Together with my postdoctoral mentor, I identified a novel mechanism in which chromatin proteins are recruited to their functioning loci. We also identified a class of proteins that together regulates sexual-lineage-specific DNA methylation in the maternal and paternal reproductive tissue. This work is currently being wrapped up for publication. My work also culminated in a senior honors thesis (unavailable for the public) and a poster presentation. For this research, I was awarded the prestigous _Nicholas Spitzer Award_ along with a five-thousand dollar scholarship.

ShanghaiTech University- _Antos Lab_
======
I was a high school researcher in Professor Christopher Antos's lab at ShanghaiTech University. I studied regeneration of zebrafish fins, in particular, how bioelectric properties impact scaling of regenerated organs. We were particularly interested in a two-pore potassium channel _kcnk5b_. I assisted a graduate student in genotyping, cloning to generate tissue specific expression of kcnk5b, and fish management. 

Tongji University- _Chen Lab_
======
I was a high school researcher in Professor Xiaoping Chen's lab at Tongji University. I studied the activation of Th2 immunity using Schistosome infections as a model. I assisted a graduate student in DNA/RNA extractions, cDNA synthesis, genotyping and FACS experiments. I also helped manage the mice colonies. The work I assisted with was eventually published:
